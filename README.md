# The Elements of Web Style
Universal techniques to improve and enhance any web UI.

## I. INTRODUCTORY
This guide is based on the author's personal experience in web design from 2005 to now. The rules I lay out are my opinions formed partly from experience in corporate, academic, government, and contractual contexts. 

My personal projects, from the days of futzing with custom CSS on a MySpace profile (R.I.P) to the concepts I implemented the "right way" (the cathartic solution to bad management), also inform this guide.

Primarily I'd like to convey, contrary to popular belief, process _can_ yield aesthetically pleasing results alongside functional results. Furthermore, that process does not have to be complex. When it comes to style, there are a lot of good heuristics floating around the web and in my head. Here's what I'd like to do with those:

- consolidate coherent and consumable rules into applicable scenarios
- differentiate conflicting good ideas by constraining or expanding them
- give concrete, demonstrable code examples

## II. CREDITS
I've taken cues from many sources over the years, many of them littered over the internet in the form of developer blog posts, question and answer forums, and good ol' comment sections. In retrospect, there's no way I could cite all the inspirations for my ideas, but I will try to give credit where credit is due throughout this guide.

I would be remiss to not give some high-level shoutouts:

- [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/ui/about.html)
  - This dude has been giving solid advice since I learned what CSS was in 2005.
- [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  - An invaluable resource of countless developers from time immemorial (actually 2008, but you know)
- [The Elements of Style](http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf)
  - A classic English reference book, the format of which I flippantly borrow.
